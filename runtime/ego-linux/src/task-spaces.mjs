/**
 * Task spaces, emulated as tracked sets of tabs.
 *
 * The app's Space is isolated *and* inherits your login state. On stock Chromium
 * those two properties look like they pull apart:
 *
 *   Target.createBrowserContext -> real isolation, but a blank cookie jar
 *   sharing the default profile -> your real logins, but no isolation
 *
 * They don't: the empty jar can be filled. A space owns a browser context seeded
 * from the default jar at creation, so it gets both — see createSeededContext
 * below and docs/isolation-with-inherited-logins.md. The seed is a point-in-time
 * copy, not live shared state, and a space that fails to get a context falls
 * back to the shared default jar.
 *
 * Spaces deliberately do NOT get their own browser window. That was the first
 * design, and it was measurably worse: a headless Chrome does not render tabs in
 * background windows, so `document.elementFromPoint` returned null for pages
 * living in a non-foreground window. That broke hit-testing, which in turn made
 * the harness's input-fallback path re-synthesise drags that had already landed
 * (see driver/pointer.ts finishDragProbe) — every canvas case in the upstream
 * e2e suite failed or double-counted strokes. One window, tracked tab sets.
 *
 * Each heredoc is a fresh Node process, so state lives in a file, not memory.
